## Glossary

Git Workflows will consistently use these terms:

| Term         | Description                                                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **origin**   | Git's default name for a remote repository, including forks.                 |
| **upstream** | The name we will use for the remote repository that a fork was created from. |
