# Configure the upstream

Add a remote called **upstream** to track the original repository:

```bash
# Replace with the original repository's values:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPOSITORY>.git
# Here's an example for this repository:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/KatieProchilo/GitWorkflows.git
```
