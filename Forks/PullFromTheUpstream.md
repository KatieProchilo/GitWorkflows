# Pull from the upstream

Pull the changes from an upstream branch to a local branch in your fork:

1. Pull from the upstream to a fork's **featureBranch**:

    ```bash
    git pull upstream featureBranch
    ```

1. Solve any conflicts.

1. Push **origin/featureBranch**:

    ```bash
    git push origin featureBranch
    ```
