# Pull changes to a fork

Get the changes from some remote branch from the upstream repository into a local branch of your fork:

1. Pull from the upstream into a **featureBranch** of a fork:

    ```bash
    git pull upstream featureBranch
    ```

1. Solve any conflicts.

1. Push **origin/featureBranch**:

    ```bash
    git push origin featureBranch
    ```
